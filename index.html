  <p>On a cold December day in 1966, I came into this world. Now, to be honest, I don't recall much about that experience itself. What has happened since is a story to be told throughout the ages.</p>
  <p>I have done a ton of living in my time. Smiles, laughter, tears, dancing, loving, fighting all have been an integral part of what has combined to make me who I am.</p>
